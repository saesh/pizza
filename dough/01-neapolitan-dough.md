# Neapolitan Pizza Dough

One of the most basic pizza doughs. Only flour, water, yeast and salt. 65% hydration. Easy.

## Expectations

The baked dough should have a light color but with dark spots, almost like a Leopard. The crust should be bubbly. The undercarriage should be thin, browned and crisp, yet airy.
